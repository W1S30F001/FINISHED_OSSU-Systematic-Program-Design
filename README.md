# The Whereabouts & The Whys
/OSSU/Core CS/1. SPD (How to Code: Simple Data) & (How to Code: Complex Data)

dedicated to & a documentation of my commitment to the OSSU track,

## The Language
all projects/exercises of this course are written in Racket, you can run it using drracket code editor

## my personal coolest work is in the [advanced] folder
Doesn't Include All (For Example: nqueens & solitaire triangles in Search directory are very cool projects)

### The Starter & Homework files link
you need to solve a good amount of the problems in the course's problem bank: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+HtC2x+2T2017/fefe3e39d3564db8a767c39187141f07/ 

~~there's a guy on gihub @s7oev who got the essential files documented, which you're going to need to do the course homework & assignments (since the free version of the course, the one on Edx, is archived i.e. files can't be viewed or downloaded) -> or get em from here (starter files only ig) https://github.com/ossu/spd-starters~~
